            <p>I often refer to the buffalo as a "wild cow", but that is far from the truth. Even though buffaloes and
                cows are closely related, they are actually different species. Outside of a game reserve, it's really
                very difficult to run into a buffalo as these are not domestic creatures.Their curved horns help them to
                fight against predators in the wild.</p>
