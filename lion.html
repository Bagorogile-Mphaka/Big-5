            <p>The kings of the jungle. Did you know that the manes of male lions tell a story? They are not only useful
                for
                attracting female lions, but they can also protect their necks during those gruesome fights they
                encounter with
                other animals. Sadly though, the lion population has diminished greatly and are on the verge of
                extinction.
                Imagine going on safari and not getting to see the great lion himself in all its glory. </p>

            <h2>Do lions eat people?</h2>
            <p>Although they don't really like the taste of humans, lions do eat people....if they have to. So stay far
                away.
