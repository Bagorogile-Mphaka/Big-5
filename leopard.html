        <p>The unofficial non-identical twin of the cheetah, the leopard is also part of the cat family. Although they
            are
            endangered in some parts of the world, we still have a very large leopard population in Sub-Sharan Africa.
            But
            don't expect to see one of these spotty creatures on a midday game drive, as they are nocturnal and prefer
            to
            come out and hunt at night. Below is a picture of the difference between leopard and cheetah spots.</p>
