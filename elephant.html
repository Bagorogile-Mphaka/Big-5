            <p>The real "kings of the jungle" according to me. Elephants are not only big and scary, but they are also
                so beautiful to look at. These very large creatures are very shy and are said to have permanent
                memories.There are two main types of elephants, the African elephant and the Asian elephant. African
                elephants are larger than the Asian ones, and have ears shaped like the African continent</p>
