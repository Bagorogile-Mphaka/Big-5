            <p> Probably one of the most endangered species of our time. These cute and chubby animals are on the verge
                of extinction due to constant poaching for their horns. Apparently their horns are used to make
                medicines in Asia. Did you know that some rhinos have only one horn, while others have two horns? In
                South Africa we have two types of rhinos, namely: the white rhino, and black rhino. The main difference
                between the two is their mouth. Black rhinos have pointy mouths, which help them to eat leaves off of
                trees, while white rhinos have square mouths, which are useful for grazing.</p>
